# Aurora Borealis Bot ðŸŒŒ

An automated bot that monitors webcams in the Oslo area for aurora borealis (northern lights) and posts them to Bluesky when detected. It now performs a darkness check (astronomical â†’ nautical â†’ civil twilight) before any forecast or image processing to avoid wasting resources in daylight.

## How It Works

1. **Darkness Gate** â€“ Fetches sunrise/sunset & twilight boundaries; exits early if it isn't dark enough.
2. **(Optional) NOAA Forecast Gate** â€“ Can be re-enabled to further skip when probability is zero.
3. **Image Download** â€“ Pulls current frames from configured public webcams.
4. **Color Pre-filter** â€“ Fast heuristic for aurora-like greens/purples to reduce AI calls.
5. **AI Confirmation** â€“ GPTâ€‘4o Vision answers yes/no for aurora presence; handles resize & rate limits.
6. **Posting** â€“ Uploads confirmed aurora with location metadata to Bluesky.

## Monitoring Locations (Current)

Defined per view in `webcam_locations.json`:
- Tryvann North West
- Tryvann North
- Tryvann South East
- Tryvann South
- Tryvann West (shares camera with South for now)
- Sylling North
- Sylling South

## Features

- **Darkness Gate**: Skips processing entirely when twilight data indicates it's still light.
- **Optional NOAA Forecast Integration**: Can be toggled back in if desired.
- **Location Tracking**: Each post includes the view where aurora was detected.
- **Fair Processing**: Shuffles webcam order to vary observation times.
- **Color Pre-filtering**: Quick scan for aurora-like colors before AI check.
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Gracefully handles API 429 & image size 413 responses.
- **Persistent State**: Remembers progress between runs.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Detection and posting counters.

## Setup

### 1. Repository Structure
```
your-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ webcam_locations.json
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ aurora-bot.yml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### 2. Required Files

**requirements.txt**:
```txt
requests
python-dotenv
Pillow
atproto
```

**webcam_locations.json**:
Contains webcam URLs organized by location (see included file).

### 3. GitHub Secrets

Set up these secrets in your repository (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

- `BSKY_HANDLE`: Your Bluesky handle (e.g., `username.bsky.social`)
- `BSKY_PASSWORD`: Your Bluesky app password (not your main password!)
- `KEY_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Azure AI token for GPT-4o vision API

### 4. Bluesky App Password

1. Go to Settings â†’ Privacy and Security â†’ App Passwords
2. Create a new app password for this bot
3. Use this password (not your main password) in the `BSKY_PASSWORD` secret

## Configuration

Edit these variables in `src/main.py`:

```python
MAX_RUNTIME_MINUTES = 20    # Max runtime per session
IMAGES_PER_SESSION = 30     # Images to process per session
## Schedule

GitHub Actions currently runs every 30 minutes during typical dark hours. Because the code now performs a dynamic darkness check, you can optionally widen the cron schedule (e.g. run 24/7) and rely on fast early exits.
## How the Detection Works

## Pipeline Overview

1. Darkness check (sunrise-sunset API)
2. (Optional) NOAA forecast gate
3. Download image & color heuristic
4. AI verification (yes/no) with resizing & retry
5. Post confirmed aurora

## Aurora Detection Details

The bot looks for:
- **Green aurora**: Bright green dominant colors in the sky
- **Purple/Pink aurora**: Reddish-purple glows
- **Night sky context**: Only valid in dark conditions
- **Natural patterns**: Distinguishes from artificial lights
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not dark enough"** â€“ Expected during daylight/twilight; bot exits quickly.
**"AI response: no"** â€“ Color heuristic can flag vegetation or lights; AI filter reduces false positives.
**"Rate limit (429)"** â€“ Azure quota exceeded; bot skips more AI calls until next run.
**"413 payload too large"** â€“ Image auto-compressed & retried.
**"Webcam unavailable"** â€“ Temporary outage; skipped.
**"No aurora colors detected"** â€“ Normal; aurora is rare.

### Best Conditions for Aurora

- **Dark skies**: Late evening through early morning
- **High KP-index**: Check aurora forecasts
- **Clear weather**: Clouds will block view
- **Winter months**: Longer dark periods

### Manual Testing

Trigger a manual run:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Aurora Borealis Bot"
3. Click "Run workflow"
